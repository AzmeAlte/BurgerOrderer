# BurgerOrderer
You and your colleagues have been contacted by a company that wants a system for
ordering burgers. There should be a web client where customers can order and customize
their burgers, and a second client where the kitchen can see which burgers need to be
prepared.
With joy in your hearts and a song on your lips, you accept the assignment. This is going to
be fun, and you don't mind that they can only pay you in fried small potatoes.
That’s when the client comes up with additional requirements. They want you to collaborate
well and use modern configuration tools; they’ve heard of "Git" and want you to use it. They
want the different clients in the project to be developed as standalone units ("Rumor has it
that Containers are the latest thing, and we don’t mean the kind you load onto ships!").
Furthermore, they want the project to maintain high quality. They have determined that "high
quality" consists of three parts. The first part is that everything should be well documented.
The second part is that there should be automated testing of the project’s most important
functionality. The third part is that you, as developers, demonstrate knowledge of basic skills
such as debugging and that you continuously reflect on what you do and strive to improve at
it.
Well, at least the small potatoes are fried. You decide to break down the client’s expectations
into three components: (1) Demonstrate the ability to collaborate using configuration tools,
(2) implement and document the project, and (3) test and demonstrate debugging skills. For
all three components, you should actively document what you do in an engineering journal,
and when you are finished, you should summarize and reflect on each of the three
components.
